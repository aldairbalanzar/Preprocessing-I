            I'm an idea machine. I once had this idea where people could
            socialize with people from around the globe, compile their friends,
            and document their everyday life, but Tom invented that. Soon after,
            I thought about making the same thing, but more user friendly and
            where people think that their privacy will be respected, but not
            really, but then Zuckerberg made that. So yea, I got bangers in my
            head, just need an enviroment that will nourish them.

              I enjoy anything programming and entrepeneural. If it has
              potential for growth I am all about it. "Personal Enrichment" is
              my other middle name. I enjoy learning new technology to stay
              relevant within the industry and to push the boundaries of what is
              possible to the best of my abilities. I enjoy working on startups
              and getting my hands dirty with the beginner stages, so that I can
              say I was there from the beginning. I hope to be able to someday
              make it as big as the Marks, Elon, and Jeff in today's time. I am
              a team player because I without a doubt believe that there is no
              "i" in team and building each other up is what I live for. If I
              were to get picked for the job now, you would have your next 4
              years of board meetings secured because of all the success I plan
              to bring... I reek of opportunity.
